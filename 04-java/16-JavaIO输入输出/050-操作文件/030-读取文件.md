# 读取文件

[TOC]

## **1. Overview**

In this tutorial, we'll explore different ways to **read from a File in Java**.

First, we'll see how to load a file from the classpath, a URL or from a JAR file, using standard Java classes.

Second, we'll see how to read the content with *BufferedReader*, *Scanner*, *StreamTokenizer*, *DataInputStream*, *SequenceInputStream,* and *FileChannel*. Also, we will discuss how to read a UTF-8 encoded file.

Finally, we’ll explore the new techniques to load and read a file in Java 7 and Java 8.

This article is part of [the “Java – Back to Basic” series](https://www.baeldung.com/java-tutorial) here on Baeldung.

## **2. Setup**

### 2.1 Input File

In most examples in this article, we'll read a text file with filename *fileTest.txt* that contains one line:

```plaintext
Hello, world!
```

In a few examples, we'll use a different file. In these cases, we'll mention the file and its content explicitly.

### 2.2 Helper Method

We will use a set of test examples using core Java classes only, and in the tests, we'll use assertions using [Hamcrest](https://www.baeldung.com/hamcrest-collections-arrays) matchers.

Tests will share a common *readFromInputStream* method that transforms an *InputStream* to *String* for easier asserting of results:

```java
private String readFromInputStream(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    StringBuilder resultStringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
    try (BufferedReader br
      = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream))) {
        String line;
        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
            resultStringBuilder.append(line).append("\n");
        }
    }
  return resultStringBuilder.toString();
}
```

Note that there are other ways of achieving the same result. You can consult [this article](https://www.baeldung.com/convert-input-stream-to-a-file) for some alternatives.

## **3. Reading a File from the Classpath**

### **3.1. Using Standard Java**

This section explains how to read a file that is available on a classpath. We'll read the “*fileTest.txt*” available under *src/main/resources*:

```java
@Test
public void givenFileNameAsAbsolutePath_whenUsingClasspath_thenFileData() {
    String expectedData = "Hello, world!";
    
    Class clazz = FileOperationsTest.class;
    InputStream inputStream = clazz.getResourceAsStream("/fileTest.txt");
    String data = readFromInputStream(inputStream);

    Assert.assertThat(data, containsString(expectedData));
}
```

**In the above code snippet, we used the current class to load a file using \*getResourceAsStream\* method and passed the absolute path of the file to load.**

The same method is available on a *ClassLoader* instance as well:

```java
ClassLoader classLoader = getClass().getClassLoader();
InputStream inputStream = classLoader.getResourceAsStream("fileTest.txt");
String data = readFromInputStream(inputStream);
```

We obtain the *classLoader* of the current class using *getClass().getClassLoader()*.

The main difference is that when using the *getResourceAsStream* on a *ClassLoader* instance, the path is treated as absolute starting from the root of the classpath.

When used against a *Class* instance*,* the path could be relative to the package, or an absolute path, which is hinted by the leading slash.

**Of course, note that in practice, open streams should always be closed**, such as the *InputStream* in our example:

```java
InputStream inputStream = null;
try {
    File file = new File(classLoader.getResource("fileTest.txt").getFile());
    inputStream = new FileInputStream(file);
    
    //...
}     
finally {
    if (inputStream != null) {
        try {
            inputStream.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### **3.2. Using the \*commons-io\* Library**

**Another common option is using the \*FileUtils\* class of the [\*commons-io\*](https://www.baeldung.com/apache-commons-io) package:**

```java
@Test
public void givenFileName_whenUsingFileUtils_thenFileData() {
    String expectedData = "Hello, world!";
        
    ClassLoader classLoader = getClass().getClassLoader();
    File file = new File(classLoader.getResource("fileTest.txt").getFile());
    String data = FileUtils.readFileToString(file, "UTF-8");
        
    assertEquals(expectedData, data.trim());
}
```

Here we pass the *File* object to the method *readFileToString()* of *FileUtils* class. This utility class manages to load the content without the necessity of writing any boilerplate code to create an *InputStream* instance and read data.

**The same library also offers the \*IOUtils\* class:**

```java
@Test
public void givenFileName_whenUsingIOUtils_thenFileData() {
    String expectedData = "Hello, world!";
        
    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("src/test/resources/fileTest.txt");
    String data = IOUtils.toString(fis, "UTF-8");
        
    assertEquals(expectedData, data.trim());
}
```

Here we pass the *FileInputStream* object to the method *toString()* of *IOUtils* class. This utility class manages to load the content without the necessity of writing any boilerplate code to create an *InputStream* instance and read data.

## **4. Reading with \*BufferedReader\***

Let's now focus on different ways to parse the content of a file.

**We'll start with a simple way to read from a file using \*BufferedReader:\***

```java
@Test
public void whenReadWithBufferedReader_thenCorrect()
  throws IOException {
     String expected_value = "Hello, world!";
     String file ="src/test/resources/fileTest.txt";
     
     BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));
     String currentLine = reader.readLine();
     reader.close();

    assertEquals(expected_value, currentLine);
}
```

Note that *readLine()* will return *null* when the end of the file is reached.

## **5. Reading from a File Using Java NIO**

In JDK7 the NIO package was significantly updated.

**Let’s look at an example using the \*Files\* class and the \*readAllLines\* method**. The *readAllLines* method accepts a *Path.*

*Path* class can be considered as an upgrade of the *java.io.File* with some additional operations in place.

### **5.1. Reading a Small File**

The following code shows how to read a small file using the new *Files* class:

```java
@Test
public void whenReadSmallFileJava7_thenCorrect()
  throws IOException {
    String expected_value = "Hello, world!";

    Path path = Paths.get("src/test/resources/fileTest.txt");

    String read = Files.readAllLines(path).get(0);
    assertEquals(expected_value, read);
}
```

Note that you can use the *readAllBytes()* method as well if you need binary data.

### **5.2. Reading a Large File**

If we want to read a large file with *Files* class, we can use the *BufferedReader:*

The following code reads the file using the new *Files* class and *BufferedReader*:

```java
@Test
public void whenReadLargeFileJava7_thenCorrect()
  throws IOException {
    String expected_value = "Hello, world!";

    Path path = Paths.get("src/test/resources/fileTest.txt");

    BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(path);
    String line = reader.readLine();
    assertEquals(expected_value, line);
}
```

### **5.3. Reading a File Using \*Files.lines()\***

**JDK8 offers the \*lines()\* method inside the \*Files\* class. It returns a \*Stream\* of String elements.**

Let’s look at an example of how to read data into bytes and decode using UTF-8 charset.

The following code reads the file using the new *Files.lines()*:

```java
@Test
public void givenFilePath_whenUsingFilesLines_thenFileData() {
    String expectedData = "Hello, world!";
         
    Path path = Paths.get(getClass().getClassLoader()
      .getResource("fileTest.txt").toURI());
         
    Stream<String> lines = Files.lines(path);
    String data = lines.collect(Collectors.joining("\n"));
    lines.close();
         
    Assert.assertEquals(expectedData, data.trim());
}
```

Using Stream with IO channels like file operations, we need to close the stream explicitly using the *close()* method.

As we can see, the *Files* API offers another easy way to read the file contents into a *String.*

In the next sections, let's have a look at other, less common methods of reading a file, that may be appropriate in some situations.

## **6. Reading with \*Scanner\***

Next, let's use a *Scanner* to read from the File. Here, we'll use whitespace as the delimiter:

```java
@Test
public void whenReadWithScanner_thenCorrect()
  throws IOException {
    String file = "src/test/resources/fileTest.txt";
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File(file));
    scanner.useDelimiter(" ");

    assertTrue(scanner.hasNext());
    assertEquals("Hello,", scanner.next());
    assertEquals("world!", scanner.next());

    scanner.close();
}
```

Note that the default delimiter is the whitespace, but multiple delimiters can be used with a *Scanner*.

**The [Scanner](https://www.baeldung.com/java-scanner) class is useful when reading content from the console, or when the content contains primitive values**, with a known delimiter (eg: a list of integers separated by space).

## **7. Reading with \*StreamTokenizer\***

Next, let's read a text file into tokens using a [*StreamTokenizer*](https://www.baeldung.com/java-streamtokenizer).

The way the tokenizer works is – first, we need to figure out what the next token is – String or number; we do that by looking at the *tokenizer.ttype* field.

Then, we'll read the actual token based on this type:

- *tokenizer.nval* – if the type was a number
- *tokenizer.sval* – if the type was a String

In this example we'll use a different input file which simply contains:

```bash
Hello 1
```

The following code reads from the file both the String and the number:

```java
@Test
public void whenReadWithStreamTokenizer_thenCorrectTokens()
  throws IOException {
    String file = "src/test/resources/fileTestTokenizer.txt";
   FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
    StreamTokenizer tokenizer = new StreamTokenizer(reader);

    // token 1
    tokenizer.nextToken();
    assertEquals(StreamTokenizer.TT_WORD, tokenizer.ttype);
    assertEquals("Hello", tokenizer.sval);

    // token 2    
    tokenizer.nextToken();
    assertEquals(StreamTokenizer.TT_NUMBER, tokenizer.ttype);
    assertEquals(1, tokenizer.nval, 0.0000001);

    // token 3
    tokenizer.nextToken();
    assertEquals(StreamTokenizer.TT_EOF, tokenizer.ttype);
    reader.close();
}
```

Note how the end of file token is used at the end.

**This approach is useful for parsing an input stream into tokens.**

## **8. Reading with \*DataInputStream\***

**We can use \*DataInputStream\* to read binary or primitive data type from a file.**

The following test reads the file using a *DataInputStream*:

```java
@Test
public void whenReadWithDataInputStream_thenCorrect() throws IOException {
    String expectedValue = "Hello, world!";
    String file ="src/test/resources/fileTest.txt";
    String result = null;

    DataInputStream reader = new DataInputStream(new FileInputStream(file));
    int nBytesToRead = reader.available();
    if(nBytesToRead > 0) {
        byte[] bytes = new byte[nBytesToRead];
        reader.read(bytes);
        result = new String(bytes);
    }

    assertEquals(expectedValue, result);
}
```

## **9. Reading with \*FileChannel\***

**If we are reading a large file, \*FileChannel\* can be faster than standard IO.**

The following code reads data bytes from the file using *FileChannel* and *RandomAccessFile*:

```java
@Test
public void whenReadWithFileChannel_thenCorrect()
  throws IOException {
    String expected_value = "Hello, world!";
    String file = "src/test/resources/fileTest.txt";
    RandomAccessFile reader = new RandomAccessFile(file, "r");
    FileChannel channel = reader.getChannel();

    int bufferSize = 1024;
    if (bufferSize > channel.size()) {
        bufferSize = (int) channel.size();
    }
    ByteBuffer buff = ByteBuffer.allocate(bufferSize);
    channel.read(buff);
    buff.flip();
    
    assertEquals(expected_value, new String(buff.array()));
    channel.close();
    reader.close();
}
```

## **10. Reading a UTF-8 Encoded File**

Now, let's see how to read a UTF-8 encoded file using *BufferedReader.* In this example, we'll read a file that contains Chinese characters:

```java
@Test
public void whenReadUTFEncodedFile_thenCorrect()
  throws IOException {
    String expected_value = "青空";
    String file = "src/test/resources/fileTestUtf8.txt";
    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader
      (new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(file), "UTF-8"));
    String currentLine = reader.readLine();
    reader.close();

    assertEquals(expected_value, currentLine);
}
```

## **11. Reading Content from URL**

To read content from a URL, we will use “*/*” URL in our example as:

```java
@Test
public void givenURLName_whenUsingURL_thenFileData() {
    String expectedData = "Baeldung";

    URL urlObject = new URL("/");
    URLConnection urlConnection = urlObject.openConnection();
    InputStream inputStream = urlConnection.getInputStream();
    String data = readFromInputStream(inputStream);

    Assert.assertThat(data, containsString(expectedData));
}
```

There are also alternative ways of connecting to a URL. Here we used the *URL* and *URLConnection* class available in the standard SDK.

## **12. Reading a File from a JAR**

To read a file which is located inside a JAR file, we will need a JAR with a file inside it. For our example we will read “*LICENSE.txt*” from the “*hamcrest-library-1.3.jar*” file:

```java
@Test
public void givenFileName_whenUsingJarFile_thenFileData() {
    String expectedData = "BSD License";

    Class clazz = Matchers.class;
    InputStream inputStream = clazz.getResourceAsStream("/LICENSE.txt");
    String data = readFromInputStream(inputStream);

    Assert.assertThat(data, containsString(expectedData));
}
```

Here we want to load *LICENSE.txt* that resides in Hamcrest library, so we will use the *Matcher's* class that helps to get a resource. The same file can be loaded using the classloader too.

## **13. Conclusion**

As you can see, there are many possibilities for loading a file and reading data from it using plain Java.

You can load a file from various locations like classpath, URL or jar files.

Then you can use *BufferedReader* to read line by line, *Scanner* to read using different delimiters, *StreamTokenizer* to read a file into tokens, *DataInputStream* to read binary data and primitive data types, *SequenceInput Stream* to link multiple files into one stream, *FileChannel* to read faster from large files, etc.
