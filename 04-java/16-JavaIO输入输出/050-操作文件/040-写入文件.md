## **1. Overview**

In this tutorial, **we'll explore different ways to write to a file using Java.** We'll make use of *BufferedWriter*, *PrintWriter*, *FileOutputStream*, *DataOutputStream*, *RandomAccessFile*, *FileChannel,* and the Java 7 *Files* utility class.

We'll also look at locking the file while writing and discuss some final takeaways on writing to file.

This tutorial is part of [the Java “Back to Basics” series](https://www.baeldung.com/java-tutorial) here on Baeldung.

## **2. Write With \*BufferedWriter\***

Let's start simple **and use \*BufferedWriter\* to write a \*String\* to a new file**:

```java
public void whenWriteStringUsingBufferedWritter_thenCorrect() 
  throws IOException {
    String str = "Hello";
    BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(fileName));
    writer.write(str);
    
    writer.close();
}
```

The output in the file will be:

```bash
Hello
```

We can then **append a \*String\* to the existing file**:

```java
@Test
public void whenAppendStringUsingBufferedWritter_thenOldContentShouldExistToo() 
  throws IOException {
    String str = "World";
    BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(fileName, true));
    writer.append(' ');
    writer.append(str);
    
    writer.close();
}
```

The file will then be:

```bash
Hello World
```

## **3. Write With \*PrintWriter\***

Next, let's see how **we can use \*PrintWriter\* to write formatted text to a file**:

```java
@Test
public void givenWritingStringToFile_whenUsingPrintWriter_thenCorrect() 
  throws IOException {
    FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter(fileName);
    PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(fileWriter);
    printWriter.print("Some String");
    printWriter.printf("Product name is %s and its price is %d $", "iPhone", 1000);
    printWriter.close();
}
```

The resulting file will contain:

```bash
Some String
Product name is iPhone and its price is 1000$
```

Note how we're not only writing a raw *String* to a file, but also some formatted text with the *printf* method.

We can create the writer using *FileWriter*, *BufferedWriter*, or even *System.out*.

## **4. Write With \*FileOutputStream\***

Let's now see how we can use *FileOutputStream* to **write binary data to a file.**

The following code converts a *String* into bytes and writes the bytes to a file using *FileOutputStream*:

```java
@Test
public void givenWritingStringToFile_whenUsingFileOutputStream_thenCorrect() 
  throws IOException {
    String str = "Hello";
    FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(fileName);
    byte[] strToBytes = str.getBytes();
    outputStream.write(strToBytes);

    outputStream.close();
}
```

The output in the file will of course be:

```bash
Hello
```

## **5. Write With \*DataOutputStream\***

Next, let's take a look at how we can use *DataOutputStream* to write a *String* to a file:

```java
@Test
public void givenWritingToFile_whenUsingDataOutputStream_thenCorrect() 
  throws IOException {
    String value = "Hello";
    FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(fileName);
    DataOutputStream outStream = new DataOutputStream(new BufferedOutputStream(fos));
    outStream.writeUTF(value);
    outStream.close();

    // verify the results
    String result;
    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(fileName);
    DataInputStream reader = new DataInputStream(fis);
    result = reader.readUTF();
    reader.close();

    assertEquals(value, result);
}
```

## **6. Write With \*RandomAccessFile\***

Let's now illustrate how to **write and edit inside an existing file** rather than just writing to a completely new file or appending to an existing one. Simply put: We need random access.

*RandomAccessFile* enables us to write at a specific position in the file given the offset — from the beginning of the file — in bytes.

**This code writes an integer value with offset given from the beginning of the file:**

```java
private void writeToPosition(String filename, int data, long position) 
  throws IOException {
    RandomAccessFile writer = new RandomAccessFile(filename, "rw");
    writer.seek(position);
    writer.writeInt(data);
    writer.close();
}
```

If we want to **read the \*int\* stored at a specific location**, we can use this method:

```java
private int readFromPosition(String filename, long position) 
  throws IOException {
    int result = 0;
    RandomAccessFile reader = new RandomAccessFile(filename, "r");
    reader.seek(position);
    result = reader.readInt();
    reader.close();
    return result;
}
```

To test our functions, let's write an integer, edit it, and finally read it back:

```java
@Test
public void whenWritingToSpecificPositionInFile_thenCorrect() 
  throws IOException {
    int data1 = 2014;
    int data2 = 1500;
    
    writeToPosition(fileName, data1, 4);
    assertEquals(data1, readFromPosition(fileName, 4));
    
    writeToPosition(fileName2, data2, 4);
    assertEquals(data2, readFromPosition(fileName, 4));
}
```

## **7. Write With \*FileChannel\***

**If we are dealing with large files, \*FileChannel\* can be faster than standard IO.** The following code writes *String* to a file using *FileChannel*:

```java
@Test
public void givenWritingToFile_whenUsingFileChannel_thenCorrect() 
  throws IOException {
    RandomAccessFile stream = new RandomAccessFile(fileName, "rw");
    FileChannel channel = stream.getChannel();
    String value = "Hello";
    byte[] strBytes = value.getBytes();
    ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(strBytes.length);
    buffer.put(strBytes);
    buffer.flip();
    channel.write(buffer);
    stream.close();
    channel.close();

    // verify
    RandomAccessFile reader = new RandomAccessFile(fileName, "r");
    assertEquals(value, reader.readLine());
    reader.close();
}
```

## **8. Write With \*Files\* Class**

Java 7 introduces a new way of working with the filesystem, along with a new utility class: *Files*.

Using the *Files* class, we can create, move, copy, and delete files and directories. It can also be used to read and write to a file:

```java
@Test
public void givenUsingJava7_whenWritingToFile_thenCorrect() 
  throws IOException {
    String str = "Hello";

    Path path = Paths.get(fileName);
    byte[] strToBytes = str.getBytes();

    Files.write(path, strToBytes);

    String read = Files.readAllLines(path).get(0);
    assertEquals(str, read);
}
```

## **9. Write to a Temporary File**

Now let's try to write to a temporary file. The following code creates a temporary file and writes a *String* to it:

```java
@Test
public void whenWriteToTmpFile_thenCorrect() throws IOException {
    String toWrite = "Hello";
    File tmpFile = File.createTempFile("test", ".tmp");
    FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(tmpFile);
    writer.write(toWrite);
    writer.close();

    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(tmpFile));
    assertEquals(toWrite, reader.readLine());
    reader.close();
}
```

As we can see, it's just the creation of the temporary file that is interesting and different. After that point, writing to the file is the same.

## **10. Lock File Before Writing**

Finally, when writing to a file, we sometimes need to make extra sure that no one else is writing to that file at the same time. Basically, we need to be able to lock that file while writing.

Let's make use of *FileChannel* to try locking the file before writing to it:

```java
@Test
public void whenTryToLockFile_thenItShouldBeLocked() 
  throws IOException {
    RandomAccessFile stream = new RandomAccessFile(fileName, "rw");
    FileChannel channel = stream.getChannel();

    FileLock lock = null;
    try {
        lock = channel.tryLock();
    } catch (final OverlappingFileLockException e) {
        stream.close();
        channel.close();
    }
    stream.writeChars("test lock");
    lock.release();

    stream.close();
    channel.close();
}
```

Note that if the file is already locked when we try to acquire the lock, an *OverlappingFileLockException* will be thrown.

## **11. Notes**

After exploring so many methods of writing to a file, let's discuss some important notes:

- If we try to read from a file that doesn't exist, a *FileNotFoundException* will be thrown.
- If we try to write to a file that doesn't exist, the file will be created first and no exception will be thrown.
- It is very important to close the stream after using it, as it is not closed implicitly, to release any resources associated with it.
- In output stream, the *close()* method calls *flush()* before releasing the resources, which forces any buffered bytes to be written to the stream.

**Looking at the common usage practices, we can see, for example, that \*PrintWriter\* is used to write formatted text, \*FileOutputStream\* to write binary data, \*DataOutputStream\* to write primitive data types, \*RandomAccessFile\* to write to a specific position, and \*FileChannel\* to write faster in larger files.** Some of the APIs of these classes do allow more, but this is a good place to start.
