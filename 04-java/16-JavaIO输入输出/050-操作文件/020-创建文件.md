# 020-创建文件

[TOC]

## 1. 简介

- 使用File创建
- 使用NIO的Files和Path
- 使用*FileOutputStream* 
- 使用[Google Guava](https://github.com/google/guava)
- 使用 [Apache Commons IO](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/)

## 2. Setup

In the examples, we'll define a constant for the file name:

```java
private final String FILE_NAME = "src/test/resources/fileToCreate.txt";
```

And we'll also add a clean-up step to make sure that the file doesn't already exist before each test, and to delete it after each test runs:

```java
@AfterEach
@BeforeEach
public void cleanUpFiles() {
    File targetFile = new File(FILE_NAME);
  	//删除文件
    targetFile.delete();
}
```

## **3.使用 NIO \*Files.createFile()\***

Let's start by **using the \*Files.createFile()\* method** from the Java NIO package:

```java
@Test
public void givenUsingNio_whenCreatingFile_thenCorrect() throws IOException {
    Path newFilePath = Paths.get(FILE_NAME);
    Files.createFile(newFilePath);
}
```

As you can see the code is still very simple; we're now using the new *Path* interface instead of the old *File*.

One thing to note here is that the new API makes good use of exceptions. If the file already exists, we no longer have to check a return code. Instead, we'll get a *FileAlreadyExistsException*:

```bash
java.nio.file.FileAlreadyExistsException: src/test/resources/fileToCreate.txt at sun.n.f.WindowsException.translateToIOException(WindowsException.java:81)
```

类似的,创建目录

```
Files.createDirectory(path); //必须中间路径都存在
Files.createDirectories(path); // 自动创建中间路径
```

## **4.** **使用 \*File.createNewFile()\***

Let's now look at how we can do the same **using the \*java.io.File\* class:**

```java
@Test
public void givenUsingFile_whenCreatingFile_thenCorrect() throws IOException {
    File newFile = new File(FILE_NAME);
    boolean success = newFile.createNewFile();
    assertTrue(success);
}
```

Note that the file must not exist for this operation to succeed. If the file does exist, then the *createNewFile()* operation will return false.

## 5. 使用FileOutputStream*

Another way to create a new file is to **use the \*java.io.FileOutputStream\***:

```java
@Test
public void givenUsingFileOutputStream_whenCreatingFile_thenCorrect() throws IOException {
    try(FileOutputStream fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream(FILE_NAME)){
    }
}
```

In this case, a new file is created when we instantiate the *FileOutputStream* object. If a file with a given name **already exists, it will be overwritten**. If, however, the existing file is a directory or a new file cannot be created for any reason, then we'll get a *FileNotFoundException*.

Additionally, note we used a *try-with-resources* statement – to be sure that a stream is properly closed.

## **6. 使用Guava**

The Guava solution for creating a new file is a quick one-liner as well:

```java
@Test
public void givenUsingGuava_whenCreatingFile_thenCorrect() throws IOException {
    com.google.common.io.Files.touch(new File(FILE_NAME));
}
```

## **7. 使用Apache Commons IO**

**The Apache Commons library provides the \*FileUtils.touch()\* method which implements the same behavior as the “\*touch\*” utility in Linux.**

Therefore it creates a new empty file or even a file and the full path to it in a file system:

```java
@Test
public void givenUsingCommonsIo_whenCreatingFile_thenCorrect() throws IOException {
    FileUtils.touch(new File(FILE_NAME));
}
```

Note that this behaves slightly differently than the previous examples: if the file already exists, the operation doesn't fail, it simply doesn't do anything.

And there we have it – 4 quick ways to create a new file in Java.

## **8. Conclusion**

In this article, we looked at different solutions for creating a file in Java. We used classes that are part of the JDK and external libraries.

The code for the examples is available [over on GitHub](https://github.com/eugenp/tutorials/tree/master/core-java-modules/core-java-io-3).

## 创建临时文件

```
Path newPath = Files.createTempFile(dir, prefox. suffix);
Path newPath = Files.createTempFile(prefix, suffix);
Path newPath = Files.createTempDirectory(dir, prefox);
Path newPath = Files.createTempDirectory(prefix);
```
