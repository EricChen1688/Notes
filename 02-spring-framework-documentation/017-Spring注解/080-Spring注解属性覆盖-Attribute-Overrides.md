## 什么是属性注解覆盖

An ***attribute override*** is an annotation attribute that *overrides* (or *shadows*) an annotation attribute in a meta-annotation. Attribute overrides can be categorized as follows.

1. **Implicit Overrides**: given attribute `A` in annotation `@One` and attribute `A` in annotation `@Two`, if `@One` is meta-annotated with `@Two`, then attribute `A` in annotation `@One` is an *implicit override* for attribute `A` in annotation `@Two` based solely on a naming convention (i.e., both attributes are named `A`).
2. **Explicit Overrides**: if attribute `A` is declared as an alias for attribute `B` in a meta-annotation via `@AliasFor`, then `A` is an *explicit override* for `B`.
3. **Transitive Explicit Overrides**: if attribute `A` in annotation `@One` is an explicit override for attribute `B` in annotation `@Two` and `B` is an explicit override for attribute `C` in annotation `@Three`, then `A` is a *transitive explicit override* for `C` following the [law of transitivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation).
