| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ENGINE_CREATED            | The process-engine this listener is attached to, has been created and is ready for API-calls. | `org.activiti…ActivitiEvent`                                 |
| ENGINE_CLOSED             | The process-engine this listener is attached to, has been closed. API-calls to the engine are no longer possible. | `org.activiti…ActivitiEvent`                                 |
| ENTITY_CREATED            | A new entity is created. The new entity is contained in the event. | `org.activiti…ActivitiEntityEvent`                           |
| ENTITY_INITIALIZED        | A new entity has been created and is fully initialized. If any children are created as part of the creation of an entity, this event will be fired AFTER the create/initialisation of the child entities as opposed to the `ENTITY_CREATE`event. | `org.activiti…ActivitiEntityEvent`                           |

| ENTITY_SUSPENDED          | An existing entity is suspended. The suspended entity is contained in the event. Will be dispatched for ProcessDefinitions, ProcessInstances and Tasks. | `org.activiti…ActivitiEntityEvent`                           |
| ENTITY_ACTIVATED          | An existing entity is activated. The activated entity is contained in the event. Will be dispatched for ProcessDefinitions, ProcessInstances and Tasks. | `org.activiti…ActivitiEntityEvent`                           |
| JOB_EXECUTION_SUCCESS     | A job has been executed successfully. The event contains the job that was executed. | `org.activiti…ActivitiEntityEvent`                           |
| JOB_EXECUTION_FAILURE     | The execution of a job has failed. The event contains the job that was executed and the exception. | `org.activiti…ActivitiEntityEvent` and `org.activiti…ActivitiExceptionEvent` |
| JOB_RETRIES_DECREMENTED   | The number of job retries have been decremented due to a failed job. The event contains the job that was updated. | `org.activiti…ActivitiEntityEvent`                           |

| JOB_CANCELED              | A job has been canceled. The event contains the job that was canceled. Job can be canceled by API call, task was completed and associated boundary timer was canceled, on the new process definition deployment. | `org.activiti…ActivitiEntityEvent`                           |
| ACTIVITY_STARTED          | An activity is starting to execute                           | `org.activiti…ActivitiActivityEvent`                         |
| ACTIVITY_COMPLETED        | An activity is completed successfully                        | `org.activiti…ActivitiActivityEvent`                         |
| ACTIVITY_CANCELLED        | An activity is going to be cancelled. There can be three reasons for activity cancellation (MessageEventSubscriptionEntity, SignalEventSubscriptionEntity, TimerEntity). | `org.activiti…ActivitiActivityCancelledEvent`                |
| ACTIVITY_SIGNALED         | An activity received a signal                                | `org.activiti…ActivitiSignalEvent`                           |
| ACTIVITY_MESSAGE_RECEIVED | An activity received a message. Dispatched before the activity receives the message. When received, a `ACTIVITY_SIGNAL` or `ACTIVITY_STARTED` will be dispatched for this activity, depending on the type (boundary-event or event-subprocess start-event) | `org.activiti…ActivitiMessageEvent`                          |
| ACTIVITY_ERROR_RECEIVED   | An activity has received an error event. Dispatched before the actual error has been handled by the activity. The event’s `activityId` contains a reference to the error-handling activity. This event will be either followed by a `ACTIVITY_SIGNALLED` event or `ACTIVITY_COMPLETE` for the involved activity, if the error was delivered successfully. | `org.activiti…ActivitiErrorEvent`                            |
| UNCAUGHT_BPMN_ERROR       | An uncaught BPMN error has been thrown. The process did not have any handlers for that specific error. The event’s `activityId` will be empty. | `org.activiti…ActivitiErrorEvent`                            |
| ACTIVITY_COMPENSATE       | An activity is about to be compensated. The event contains the id of the activity that is will be executed for compensation. | `org.activiti…ActivitiActivityEvent`                         |
| VARIABLE_CREATED          | A variable has been created. The event contains the variable name, value and related execution and task (if any). | `org.activiti…ActivitiVariableEvent`                         |
| VARIABLE_UPDATED          | An existing variable has been updated. The event contains the variable name, updated value and related execution and task (if any). | `org.activiti…ActivitiVariableEvent`                         |
| VARIABLE_DELETED          | An existing variable has been deleted. The event contains the variable name, last known value and related execution and task (if any). | `org.activiti…ActivitiVariableEvent`                         |
| TASK_ASSIGNED             | A task has been assigned to a user. The event contains the task | `org.activiti…ActivitiEntityEvent`                           |
| TASK_CREATED              | A task has been created. This is dispatched after the `ENTITY_CREATE` event. In case the task is part of a process, this event will be fired before the task listeners are executed. | `org.activiti…ActivitiEntityEvent`                           |
| TASK_COMPLETED            | A task has been completed. This is dispatched before the `ENTITY_DELETE` event. In case the task is part of a process, this event will be fired before the process has moved on and will be followed by a `ACTIVITY_COMPLETE` event, targeting the activity that represents the completed task. | `org.activiti…ActivitiEntityEvent`                           |
| PROCESS_COMPLETED         | A process has been completed. Dispatched after the last activity `ACTIVITY_COMPLETED `event. Process is completed when it reaches state in which process instance does not have any transition to take. | `org.activiti…ActivitiEntityEvent`                           |
| PROCESS_CANCELLED         | A process has been cancelled. Dispatched before the process instance is deleted from runtime. Process instance is cancelled by API call `RuntimeService.deleteProcessInstance` | `org.activiti…ActivitiCancelledEvent`                        |
| MEMBERSHIP_CREATED        | A user has been added to a group. The event contains the ids of the user and group involved. | `org.activiti…ActivitiMembershipEvent`                       |
| MEMBERSHIP_DELETED        | A user has been removed from a group. The event contains the ids of the user and group involved. | `org.activiti…ActivitiMembershipEvent`                       |
| MEMBERSHIPS_DELETED       | All members will be removed from a group. The event is thrown before the members are removed, so they are still accessible. No individual `MEMBERSHIP_DELETED` events will be thrown if all members are deleted at once, for performance reasons. | `org.activiti…ActivitiMembershipEvent`                       |
