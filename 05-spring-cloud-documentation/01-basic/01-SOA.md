#  SOA-面向服务的架构

> A service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network. The basic principles of service-oriented architecture are independent of vendors, products and technologies. A service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently, such as retrieving a credit card statement online.

SOA 是一种设计方法,其中包含多个服务,而服务之间可以通过配合最终会提供一些列功能。一个服务通常以独立的形式存在于操作系统中。服务之间通过网络调用,而非进程内调用的形式进行通讯
