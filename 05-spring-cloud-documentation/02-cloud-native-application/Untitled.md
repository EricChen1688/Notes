Today Let`s talk about six thing that native einglish speacker never say. This is a guide to help English language learners like you to sound more natural , more native-like , and i choice these six things based on real-life conversations and things that non-native English speaker or English Learners say all the time .

I know that some people might disagree with me on these things ,So let me just abridge  the title just a little bit and say these are six things that native speaker will rarely ever say and that just not common or natural to hear native English speakers say .

These are quite cultural things as well . They’’re actually grammatically correct every single one of them so the problem is not grammer , the problem with these phrases is that they’re just not natural normal or culturally correct .

- Can I practice my English with you?
- I am fine, thank you. And you?How do you do?
- You look tired. You look a little fat.
- Are you married?
- How much rent do you pay? How much is your salary?

## Can I practice my English with you?

Obvious if you’re a native speaker ,you don’t need to practice your english beacuse it’s a skill that you already have , and most importantly you realize that English is a tool that you use every day to communicate ,not to practice English for English’s sake but to use English in order to communicate, to connect, to convey information and to make friends .

so I highly suggest that instead of asking ‘Can I practice my English with you ‘ ,that you approach connecting with other English speakers in a more natual friendly way , do not view other English speakers as potential practice partners or people that should teach you English , unless you’re actually working with a tutor or a teacher .

Other English Speakers are not necessarily interested in just practicing to help you improve your English .They are interested however in connectiong with you if have a common interest or perhaps a common career or a habby, so look for these common threads between you and people who happen to speak English ,and you’ll be able to pratice your English in an indirect way when you simply connect with people who are interested in the same things as you .

## I am fine , thank you ,and you ?

I know some people say this in English ,but it sounds to me very stilted[不自然的] and unnatural because it’s not very common ,it’s quite rare to hear this ,and it’s not used as much in United States in fact It almost sounds too formal to me because with my colleagues and friends we use a variety of greetings like

- how are you

- how are you doing

- how are you today

- how’s it going

but I don’t remember thet last time that I ‘ve said “I’m fine . thank you ,and you “ to respond , nomal response would be

- great , how are you

- fine ,what’s going on
- I’m good , what’s go on with you
- awesome , How about you

so even “How about you “ is a little bit more common that “and you “.

## How do you do

This is definitely American English , I don’t think I’ve heard an American English speaker use this unless they were imitating a British English speaker or trying to be funny . It’s just not common . I don’t know is this more common in England or in other countries I can tell you for sure American English speakers do not ask “how do you do”,

The only time that you’ll hear an American English speaker asking how do you do if there is more words in the sentence ,like :

- how do you do that
- how do you do your hair it looks great
- how do you do your homework
- we never ask simply how do you do to ask some one how are you .

## You look tired. You look a little fat.

In general nagative observations are just not really socially savvy so so many thimes I ‘ve had students and even international friends just directly tell me negative observations about my appearance and it’s not normal for me so it was really shocaking they would just say wow you look really tired or you look hungover or you looking a little fat ,

This is so shocking because people don’t normally comment on your apperance unless they’re your friend so I’m talking about acquaintances or people you just met or people you don’t know very well .

Family members / close friends we might say like you look a little tired ,are you ok? but i don’t think I would even tell my best friend if she looked fat ,to be honest beacuse it’s like a big insult .In Ameriacn culture unless you want to offend someone , I will not advice you to tell them they’re looking a little fat .

## Are you married?

If you just meet someone .It’s really direct ,so any kind of personal question like are you married? are you single ? are you rich ? It’s little too personal if you don’t konw the person like if you haven’t met them several times .

I guess It’s more common in other cultures to ask directly straight way if someone is married. I’ve had so many Uber dirvers ask me if I’m married It makes me really uncomfortable beacuse I’m like I’me just here for a ride to the airport didn’t want to date you so why are you asking if I’m married. And for me , It’s really strange and in American culture in general if I could be a representative of American culture .

In American culture , we don’t really ask if someone ‘s married or single until we know them a little bit .In United States , American students would not share their age in a self-introduction , in fact in job interviews , It’s illegal to ask someone how old they are or if they’re married or personal details like that It is discrimination .

## How much rent do you pay? How much is your salary?
It’s could be lumped in with the personal that I just talked about ,but it’s more of a money question , so any question are directly related to money like how much do you make , or how much rent do you pay or how much did you pay for your car , question like this are not appropriate culturally in the US , so native speakers dont ask them unless you already konw the person ,

So ,the key here is how close are you to the person , are they really your friend and you had several conversations with them ,have they asked to use some persional details ,you could ask is it ok if i ask you something personal before you ask a money question ,or a personal question , if you really really want to know .
